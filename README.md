1- palindrom_string 
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2-Manipulate list items.dart
Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
