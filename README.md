<h4>
1- palindrom_string <br>
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.<br>
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.<br>

<h4>
2-Manipulate list items.dart<br>
Let’s say you are given a list saved in a variable:<br>
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. <br>
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.<br>

<h4>
3- Rock, paper and scissors game<br>
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game against computer.<br>
Ask for player’s input, compare them, print out a message to the winner.<br>

<h4>
4- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.<br>
Ask the user to guess the number,<br>
then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.<br>
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.<br>

<h4>
5- Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.<br>

<h4>
6-Write a program that takes a list of numbers for example<br>
a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]<br>
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list <br>

-------------------------------------------------
<h4>
7-Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them<br>
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.<br>

-------------------------------------------------
<h4>
8-Write a program that takes a list<br>
and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.<br>
code : https://cutt.us/8cntT<br>
-------------------------------------------------
<h4>
9-Write a program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.<br>
For example, say I type the string:<br>
 My name is Michele<br>
Then I would see the string:<br>
 Michele is name My<br>

<h4>
10-Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user.<br>
The game works like this:<br>
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number.<br>
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”.<br>
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.”<br>
Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have.<br>
Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.<br>
Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.<br>

<h4>
11- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target<br>
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.<br>
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.<br>
 You can return the answer in any order.<br>
 Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9<br>
Output: [0,1]<br>
 Example 2 :<br>
 Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6<br>
 Output: [0,1]<br>
